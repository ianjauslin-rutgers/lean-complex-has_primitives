We define the notion of a primitive as follows.



\begin{definition}[Has Primitives]
  \label{HasPrimitives}
  \lean{HasPrimitives}\leanok
  Given a set $U\subset\mathbb C$, for any differentiable $f:U\to\mathbb C$, there exists a differentiable $g:U\to\mathbb C$ such that $g'=f$ on $U$.
\end{definition}


This is Moreira's theorem.
\begin {theorem}[Moreira's theorem]
\label {moreira}
\lean {moreira}\leanok
Let $f$ be a continuous function on a disc $D(c,r)$, and suppose that $f$ vanishes on rectangles in $D(c,r)$. Then $f$ has a primitive on $D(c,r)$.
