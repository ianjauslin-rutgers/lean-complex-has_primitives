\title{Complex Analysis: Has Primitives}
\author{Rutgers Lean Seminar}

%
% This is a blueprint for the HasPrimitives project, written by the Rutgers Lean Group
% 
% This blueprint can be edited like a standard LaTeX document.
%
% There are 3 useful commands that are specific to lean:
%   * \lean{ref}: is used in a definition, lemma or theorem, and is the name of
%                 the lean object corresponding to the definition, lemma or theorem.
%   * \leanok: is used in a lemma or theorem: marks that the lemma or theorem
%              has been fully formalized
%   * \uses{ref}: is used in a proof environment: specifies which lean objects
%                 are used in the proof

\begin{document}
\maketitle

This project aims to formalize a proof that holomorphic functions on simply connected open sets have primitives.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:has_primitives}
  \lean{has_primitives}
  Given a set $U\subset\mathbb C$, for any differentiable $f:U\to\mathbb C$, there exists a differentiable $g:U\to\mathbb C$ such that $f'=g$ on $U$.
\end{definition}
