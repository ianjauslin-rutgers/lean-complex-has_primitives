% This is a blueprint for the HasPrimitives project, written by the Rutgers Lean Group
% 
% This blueprint can be edited like a standard LaTeX document.
%
% There are 3 useful commands that are specific to lean:
%   * \lean{leanref}: is used in a definition, lemma or theorem, and is the
%		      name of the lean object corresponding to the definition,
%		      lemma or theorem.
%   * \leanok: is used in a lemma or theorem: marks that the lemma or theorem
%              has been fully formalized
%   * \uses{ref}: is used in a proof environment: specifies which definitions,
%                 lemma, theorems are used in the proof. Note that 'ref' is a
%                 LaTeX ref, not a lean one.

This project aims to formalize a proof that holomorphic functions on simply connected open sets have primitives.

\section{Main result}


We define the notion of a primitive as follows.

\begin{definition}
  \label{hasPrimitives}
  \lean{hasPrimitives}\leanok
  Given a set $U\subset\mathbb C$, for any differentiable $f:U\to\mathbb C$, there exists a differentiable $g:U\to\mathbb C$ such that $f'=g$ on $U$.
\end{definition}

The main result is

\begin{theorem}
  \label{hasPrimitivesOfSimplyConnected}
  \lean{hasPrimitivesOfSimplyConnected}\leanok
  \uses{hasPrimitives}
  Given an open, simply connected set $U\subset\mathbb C$, $U$ has primitives, in the sense of Definition \ref{hasPrimitives}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{hasPrimitivesOfDisc}
  sorry
\end{proof}

\section{Primitives on a convex set}
The idea of the proof of the main theorem is to first prove it on a convex set, and then to extend to all simply connected sets.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{hasPrimitivesOfConvex}
  \lean{hasPrimitivesOfConvex}\leanok
  \uses{hasPrimitives}
  An open convex set has primitives, in the sense of Definition \ref{hasPrimitives}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{linint,diffOfIntegrals,derivOfLinint}
  Consider a convex set $U$ and a point $z_0\in U$.
  Given a function $f$ that is holomorphic on $U$, we construct its primitive by integrating $f$ over a line from $z_0$ to $z$: for $z\in U$,
  \begin{equation}
    g(z)=\int_{z_0\to z}\ f(z)\ dz
  \end{equation}
  where $\int_{z_0\to z}$ is defined in Definition \ref{linint}.
  We are then left with proving that $g$ is differentiable and that $g'=f$.

  To do so, we compute
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{g(z+h)-g(z)}h
    =
    \frac{\int_{z_0\to z+h} f(x)\ dx-\int_{z_0\to z} f(x)\ dx}h
  \end{equation}
  which by Lemma \ref{diffOfIntegrals}, is
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{g(z+h)-g(z)}h
    =
    \frac{\int_{z\to z+h} f(x)\ dx}h
    .
  \end{equation}
  We then conclude using Lemma \ref{derivOfLinint}.
\end{proof}

The integral over the line from $z_1$ to $z_2$ is defined as follows.

\begin{definition}
  \label{linint}
  \lean{linint}\leanok
  Given $z_1,z_2\in\mathbb C$ and a function $f:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$, the path from $z_1$ to $z_2$ is defined as
  \begin{equation}
    \gamma(t):=z_1(1-\cos(t\pi))+z_2\cos(t\pi)
  \end{equation}
  and $\int_{z_1\to z_2}$ is defined as the complex integral along this path.
\end{definition}

In the proof of Theorem \ref{hasPrimitivesOfDisc}, we use the following lemmas.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{diffOfIntegrals}
  \lean{diffOfIntegrals}\leanok
  \uses{linint}
  Given a convex open set $U$, $z_0,z_1,z_2\in U$ and a function $f$ that is holomorphic on the unit complex disc,
  \begin{equation}
    \int_{z_0\to z_1} f(x)\ dx
    -
    \int_{z_0\to z_2} f(x)\ dx
    =
    \int_{z_2\to z_1} f(x)\ dx
    .
  \end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Consider the path $z_0\to z_1\to z_2$.
  Since $U$ is convex, the area enclosed by this path is a subset of $U$.
  Therefore, by Cauchy's theorem, the integral of $f$ over this path is 0.
  We conclude the proof by splitting the path into its components.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{derivOfLinint}
  \lean{derivOfLinint}\leanok
  \uses{linint}
  Given a continuous function $f:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$ and $z_0\in\mathbb C$,
  \begin{equation}
    \lim_{h\to0}\frac1h\int_{z_0\to z_0+h}f(x)\ dx=f(z_0)
    .
  \end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Since $f$ is continuous,
  \begin{equation}
    \int_{z_0\to z_0+h}f(x)\ dx
    =
    \int_{z_0\to z_0+h}f(z_0)+o(1)\ dx
    =
    hf(z_0)+o(h)
    .
  \end{equation}
\end{proof}
